<h4> DESCRIPTION </h4>
<ul>
	<li>Here, we are trying to make one in all task management web application. Here, in this project, every user can create their account and then manage tasks and maintain a to-do using a simple yet intuitive User Interface.</li>
	<li>The user can broadly classify all tasks in 3 broad categories which are Personal, Work, and Others. Whereas, others is a specific section where user can put all the task which are neither closely associated to the work or personal category.</li>
	<li>Also, a user can update the progress of the task. Updating is broadly classified into 4 categories which are 'IN PROGRESS', 'COMPLETED', 'NOT STARTED' and the user can also 'CANCEL' a task.</li>
	<li>Also, all the ongoing, future and completed tasks can be seen on the Dashboard where completed tasks, cancelled tasks and the tasks for which deadline has passed will go in the Archived section where completed tasks will be marked as 'COMPLETE', the one whose deadline is crossed is marked as 'INCOMPLETE' and the cancelled one as 'CANCELLED'.</li>
	<li>Whereas rest which are still ongoing and are not cancelled are in Active section.</li> 
</ul>
